It is in the best interest of TrueCoders to make sure you graduate the course with flying colors. However, there are several ways you can fail the course:

1. Not showing up to class or missing several class days
1. Misconduct of any kind
1. Failing course assignments too many weeks in a row
1. Not doing assignments the instructors assign to you
