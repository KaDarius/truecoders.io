reviews:
- teammate: Martin Murphy
  body: Willing to go the distance for the cause, his gaming background makes him
    fast with numbers and a natural problem solver. I see him playing a critical role
    as a developer in any organization that snaps him up.
- teammate: Cody Winton
  body: KaDarius is intelligent and never stops learning what he needs to know to
    get the job done. I'd recommend KaDarius for a programming position.
