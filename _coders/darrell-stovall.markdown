Having recently retired after 25 years as a public school teacher, I decided to   pursue a new career in programming. My interest in the field began to take shape   when I created coding lessons for my gifted middle school students. Their excitement   over solving those kinds of problems was contagious. Iâ€™ve been investing the last   several months in learning as much as I can to prepare myself for a programming   position, and I am interested in finding a company which shares my values and   passions, where I can learn, grow, and make a positive difference.
