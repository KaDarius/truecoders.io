I’m very interested in learning new technologies. Recently I’ve worked for a small business providing tech support along with website administration for their business website. I’m excited to be learning new skillsets in development with TrueCoders. I’ve found development fascinating as it provides a combination of creative outlook and organization. I hope to learn much more and become increasingly passionate as a developer.
