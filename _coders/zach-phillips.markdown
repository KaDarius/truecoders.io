I’m excited to be learning new skillsets and technologies in development with TrueCoders. I’ve found development fascinating as it provides a combination of creative outlook and organization. I'm a motivated self learner and detail oriented team player with strong organizational skills. I hope to learn much more and become increasingly passionate as a developer.
