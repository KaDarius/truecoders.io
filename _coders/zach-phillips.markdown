Since a very young age I’ve been interested in learning new technologies. I’ve been able to work as a website administrator for my church’s Wordpress site and most recently worked for a small business providing tech support along with Wordpress administration for their business website. I’m very excited to be learning new skillsets in development with TrueCoders. One
thing I’ve found fascinating about development is it provides a combination of creative outlook and organization. I hope to learn much more and become increasingly passionate as a developer.
