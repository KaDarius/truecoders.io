I, Austin Redmayne, am and always have been highly intrigued by
the open range of the technology field. Growing up I became very
familiar with OS installation, virus protection/removal, and most of
all troubleshooting. The possibilities are limitless and that in itself
has my attention. As a musician, I am always looking for an
expressive outlet and the Application and Web Development field
fuels my fixation for that creativity. The realm of possibilities are
limitless for this field and that in itself has my attention. I am
currently in school for Computer Programming with TrueCoders. I
believe that this program will have properly prepared me to be
very successful in the Developer industry along with my skills I
have acquired in life experiences.
