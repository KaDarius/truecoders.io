I'm an aspiring developer who loves what I do. I'm always looking to better myself in my craft. I've been a part of the tech team at my church for two years. I also have experience with audio mixing, recording, and media as a DJ. Lastly, I have experience with landscaping.

I am familiar with C# and .NET and the main web languages (HTML, CSS, JS). I also enjoy Front End (Web) development.
