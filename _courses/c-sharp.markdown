- title: Testing
  body: How do you know your right until you test?  The reality is that if you haven't
    tested then you've got something wrong. Knowing how to property test your code
    for accuracy and security is one of the very first steps in becoming a coder and
    is critical becoming someone who delivers things that just work.
- title: Utilities
  body: Without a working knowledge of the tools of the trade how are you expected
    to be valuable in the workplace? Learning the essentials utilities of the trade
    are as critical as a plumber knowing how to use a wrench. It's absolutely essential
    that you know how to get around VPN, RDP and have a basic working knowledge of
    networking and file permissions.
- title: Source Control
  body: There are no respectable programmers that don't know how to use source control
    these days and we wouldn't feel good about ourselves if we didn't cover Git in
    depth and a common working knowledge of all the other market leaders in source
    control. Tips and tricks and best practices included!
- title: Logging
  body: Knowing how to setup, configure and write code with proper logging conventions
    can save hours of debugging time when fixing a problem in production. We cover
    the market leader log4net in depth and give you strategies so that you can keep
    things running smooth, on their machine and not just yours.
- title: Browsers
  body: Browser tooling cross all language and platform barriers when developing for
    the web.  A large knowledge of Webkit based debuggers (Chrome, Safari) can change
    your world as we shift towards more and more happening on the client side instead
    of after POST back. This skillset is an amplifier across all web frameworks you
    come across.
- title: Relational Databases
  body: You can't throw a rock without hitting a company that's using a relational
    database. Honing your talent here will make you the "goto person" at any organization
    and will secure your place in the organization. In this course we'll learn not
    just how to write the SQL but how to performance tune it so that it spins like
    a top!
- title: Diagnostics
  body: Diagnostic skills can be learned and developed just like anything else and
    we are going to give you the ultimate cheat sheet to getting to the bottom of
    the problem/bug. Learn how to be the one with all the answers and the world is
    your oyster. Or as Capcom says... "Knowledge is power"
- title: C# / ASP.NET MVC
  body: C# is one of the hottest skillsets in the market these days. Proficiency in
    this framework will virtually guarantee your place in the market. End to end from
    language basics, design patterns, tips and tricks, and gotchas.  We have it all
    covered here.
- title: Architecture
  body: Design Patterns, Design Patterns, Design Patterns. If you don't know the common
    design patterns then it's virtually assured that you aren't writing testable code.
    Undoubtably one of the most important parts of the course.
- title: Communication
  body: Gone is the day of grey beards sitting in the dark by themselves coding for
    hours. The best programmers today have lots of friends. If it's a lone soldier
    up against an army, I'm betting on the army every time. Learn how to expand your
    network and fully leverage the coders you know by being connected and being engaged.
    We'll help you get started!
